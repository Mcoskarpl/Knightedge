This is a website for anybody to try their chances on problem ,,Knightedge" where you have a board of chess knights, and you make hole in it so every knight have a path onto edge, without stepping one on another. Least holes wins!
Bugs:
There's a glitch where after deleting red square, it will remain white/orange, when it's supposed to be brown, you can fix it by just reclicking "neighbor" red square.
